const STORY_STYLE_RULES: Record<StoryStyle, string> = {
  clinical: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — CLINICAL:
Voice: a sharp attending physician teaching a case on rounds. Precise, confident, economical.
World: real clinical settings are allowed and expected here — wards, ORs, clinics, patients, doctors.
Devices: ground the mechanism in a concrete clinical vignette (a specific presentation, a specific decision point). Every sentence should carry diagnostic or mechanistic weight — no filler.
Avoid: flowery language, jokes, or genre trappings. This is the one style where "boring but bulletproof" beats "creative."`,

  dramatic: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — DRAMATIC:
Voice: literary, theatrical, high emotional stakes — think stage play or awards-season screenplay, not a soap opera.
World: personal and human stakes with real weight: an inheritance dispute, a courtroom reckoning, a reunion after years apart, a storm-battered household, a rivalry between siblings. Do NOT default to a hospital deathbed scene — that is the cliché this style must avoid.
Devices: build tension through what a character wants and what stands in their way; let the medical mechanism BE the obstacle or the turning point (e.g. a betrayal that mirrors an enzyme being blocked, a locked door that mirrors a channel closing). Use short, weighted sentences at the climax.
Avoid: melodrama for its own sake, generic hospital-drama tropes, and opening with a diagnosis.`,

  comedy: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — COMEDY:
Voice: a sharp sitcom writer's room — witty, fast, character-driven humor, not dad-joke puns.
World: everyday absurd chaos: a wedding gone wrong, an office prank war, a family road trip, a reality-TV competition, roommates feuding over rent. Never set it in a hospital or clinic.
Devices: build the joke through escalating misunderstanding or a character's specific flaw, and land the mechanism as the PUNCHLINE, not a footnote after the joke. Comic timing matters — vary sentence length, save the biggest laugh for the last line.
Avoid: random silliness disconnected from the mechanism, and "doctor tells a joke" framing.`,

  fantasy: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — FANTASY:
Voice: epic high-fantasy narration — a chronicle of kingdoms, oaths, and magic.
World: build a small but vivid magic system where the medical mechanism becomes the RULE of that world — a spell, a curse, a guild's law, a creature's power, a kingdom's border. (Example logic, don't copy verbatim: a receptor becomes a locked gate only one key-bearer may open; an enzyme cascade becomes a chain of ritual spells each triggering the next.)
Devices: named realms, artifacts, and titles; a quest structure (a hero seeks/blocks/restores something) that mirrors the mechanism's steps in order.
Avoid: generic "wizard casts a spell" hand-waving — the magic's internal logic must map 1:1 onto the real mechanism.`,

  horror: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — HORROR:
Voice: slow-building psychological dread — atmospheric, controlled, unsettling rather than gory.
World: gothic or eerie non-clinical settings: an abandoned house, a fog-locked village, a cursed family heirloom, a night shift at an empty building, a childhood home with one door that's never opened. Do not default to hospital-horror.
Devices: build dread through what's implied, not shown; give the mechanism a "monster" or "curse" that behaves exactly like the real biological process, with a final unsettling image that seals the memory.
Avoid: cheap jump-scares in prose form, gore for shock value, and hospital/patient framing.`,

  scifi: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — SCI-FI:
Voice: crisp, speculative, technically confident — think a season-finale twist from a smart space or cyberpunk series.
World: a spaceship, a colony under a dome, a neural-implant city, an AI construct, a derelict station — the medical mechanism becomes a SYSTEM (life-support subroutine, security protocol, power relay, alien biology) with its own internal rules.
Devices: name the tech precisely (a console, a protocol, a override code) and let the system's failure/success map exactly onto the mechanism's steps.
Avoid: generic "in the future..." throat-clearing and hospital-in-space defaults.`,

  historical: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — HISTORICAL:
Voice: grounded period narration with specific, accurate-feeling texture of a real era.
World: pick ONE concrete historical setting (e.g. a Roman legion camp, a medieval royal court, a Victorian shipping company, a WWII resistance cell, a 1920s speakeasy) and stay inside it — real stakes of that era, not a modern story in costume.
Devices: let period-accurate objects, ranks, or customs stand in for the mechanism's components; the story's conflict should resolve through the same sequence as the real process.
Avoid: vague "long ago" settings, and modern dialogue or slang bleeding into the era.`,

  detective: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — DETECTIVE:
Voice: hardboiled noir narration — clipped, wary, a case being worked one clue at a time.
World: a private investigator's office, a rain-soaked street, a locked-room case, a suspect list — never a hospital ward.
Devices: structure the story as an investigation: a clue is found, a suspect is questioned, a red herring appears, the mechanism is the culprit "confession" at the end. Each clue should correspond to one step of the real mechanism, revealed in the correct order.
Avoid: forensic-pathologist-in-a-morgue framing (too close to clinical) — keep it street-level noir, not medical examiner procedural.`,

  movie: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — MOVIE:
Voice: blockbuster trailer narration — punchy, cinematic, propulsive, present tense energy even in past tense prose.
World: a hero-vs-villain set piece — a heist, a rescue, a countdown, a final confrontation — staged anywhere except a hospital.
Devices: open mid-action, use short punchy sentence fragments for impact beats, and land the mechanism as the "big reveal" or "twist" moment right before the climax.
Avoid: slow scene-setting; get to the stakes in the first line, and never open on a diagnosis.`,

  anime: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — ANIME:
Voice: shonen-battle energy — internal monologue, named special moves, rival dynamics, dramatic escalation.
World: a tournament arc, a rival showdown, a training arc, a team of specialists each with one "power" — the mechanism becomes a named technique or power-up with clear rules.
Devices: give the technique a bold declared name that encodes the real mechanism, build a rival or teammate dynamic, and escalate to a climactic clash where the technique's rule decides the outcome.
Avoid: hospital settings, and power-ups with no logical link back to the actual mechanism.`,

  meme: `WRITING PHILOSOPHY — MEME RECALL™:
Voice: current internet voice — punchy, self-aware, hyperbolic, quotable in one line, like a viral thread or a caption that would actually get shared.
World: relatable everyday chaos reframed as a meme scenario (group chat drama, "POV: you are the [X]", a chaotic group project, main-character-energy moments) — never a hospital.
Devices: use exaggerated stakes for comic effect, at least one quotable "this is the line people screenshot" sentence, and map the mechanism onto the meme's internal logic so the joke only fully lands if you know the fact.
Avoid: cringe try-hard slang stuffed in for its own sake — the humor must still turn on the medical mechanism, not replace it.`,

  return `You are a world-class medical memory architect for MBBS students, currently writing in the ${storyStyle.toUpperCase()} style. Your only goal: make this concept IMPOSSIBLE to forget. Generic explanations OR a story that could have been written in any other style are both failure conditions — the writing philosophy below is not decoration, it is the actual assignment.

Topic: "${topic}"
Subject: ${subject}

${STORY_STYLE_RULES[storyStyle]}${forbiddenOpeners}

STRICT RULES:

1. EXPLANATION: Exactly 3-4 sentences, max 6 lines. 70% precise medical jargon (mechanism, pathway, receptor-level detail) + 30% a vivid real-world analogy that makes the mechanism click instantly. High-yield only — the one fact that decides exam marks. This field stays clear and educational regardless of story style — it is the "answer key," not part of the performance.

2. THE MNEMONIC: ${MNEMONIC_TYPE_RULES[mnemonicType]}

3. THE STORYLINE:
- EXACTLY 4 LINES in one cohesive paragraph (or the spatial-map equivalent if mnemonic type is "spatial")
- Written entirely in the ${storyStyle} voice and world described above — not a clinical summary with genre words sprinkled on top
- NO alphabet/letter explanations ever
- Characters, forces, or zones must literally and physically/visually represent the medical mechanism step by step, using the ${storyStyle} world's own internal logic
- Should read like a professionally written piece of ${storyStyle} fiction a person would actually want to read — not a teaching aid wearing a costume

4. VISUAL SCENE: A vivid scene description of the exact storyline above, set in ${STORY_STYLE_SETTING_HINT[storyStyle]} — same characters/zones, same action/layout, specific pose/expression/props/positions. This will be fed directly to an image generator using a ${visualStyle === 'sketchy' ? 'Sketchy-style hand-drawn medical illustration' : 'Osmosis-style flat-vector whiteboard illustration'} renderer, so be concrete and literal about every visual element, not abstract.

5. QUICK QUIZ: One short, punchy self-test question that can be answered in one phrase, directly testing the highest-yield fact from the explanation — and its one-line answer.
